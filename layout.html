enormouse impact on the user's ability to easily complete the form and
achieve what it is they set out to do. There has been plenty of research
into the impact of different approaches to presenting form elements and 
from this we can derive a number of simple design patterns that 
standardise and streamline the <a href="user-experience">user experience</a>.</p><p>It has long been known that people browsing the Web don’t read, they scan. 
This was a fact known in 1997 and yet still forms everywhere require the 
users to dissect what they’re presented with, read through too many verbose 
instructions, and move across the page in an unintuitive manner. We can
do better than this.</p></section><nav class="contents"><h2>Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#group-content">Group Content</a></li><li><a href="#paging">Paging</a></li><li><a href="#whitespace">Whitespace</a></li><li><a href="#single-column">Single Column</a></li><li><a href="#positioning-labels">Positioning Labels</a></li><li><a href="#sources">Sources</a></li><li><a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a></li></ul></nav><section id="group-content"><h2>Group Content</h2><p>First and foremost, break the content into digestible chunks. This isn’t 
necessarily a problem for short forms like log-ins or newsletter subscriptions, 
but for anything longer it is 
worth taking the time to break the content - the questions, the fields, 
and associated information - into sensible groupings. This can also solve 
<strong>problems of meaning</strong>, where the way content presented can be
ambiguous and confusing: for example, when purchasing an item an address 
field may refer to the delivery address or address associated with a credit 
card - simply breaking up the form into payment and delivery sections 
reduces the potential for confusion. For more information, see page 54 
of Forms That Work (link below).</p><p>If the groupings are more than a few in number, then adding headings is 
a good way to make the form scannable and allow the user to orientate 
themselves. This is also great for <a href="a11y">accessibility</a> 
as screen readers can use headings to build a hierarchy for blind users. 
Headings should, however, only even be used in a strictly nested order 
- level 2 headings only after a level 1 heading, level 3’s only after a level 2, etc.
Rob Dobson explains why in the video tutorial linked below.</p></section><section id="paging"><h2>Paging</h2><aside><span class="term">What exactly is a wizard?</span>Similar in many ways to a multi-paged form, but the focus is on easy-to-answer 
questions and a default state that simplifies an otherwise complex process.</aside><p>Paging is worth doing once the form becomes overwhelming when viewed in 
one go. There are no numerical minimum or maximum numbers on the ideal 
number of elements to a page, or total number of pages, it all entirely 
depends on the users and the domain at hand. Obviously, this is not all 
that helpful in identifying if your form needs to be split into multiple 
pages, nor is it helpful in identifying if your twenty page form is too 
long. It is this, more than anything, that benefits from user research. 
In some cases, as advised by gov.uk, it may make sense to split every 
question onto a separate page, whilst in other cases it may make sense 
to just give the user everything they need (though this is far less likely).</p><p>So what if you don’t have time to do user research? Ask yourself how willing 
will your users be to spending time getting through these questions. If 
the answer is not “very willing” then splitting the questions into digestible 
chunks is probably wise, and it is probably a good idea to err on the 
side of too many divisions. Just not too many that users get tired of
pressing next.</p><p>Also, when using paging it is absolutely a good idea to perform <a href="validation">validation</a> 
on what the user has entered. Getting to the end of the long multi-page 
form to be told that some information on page 2 is incorrect is not fun. 
Especially, if the subsequent pages then getting wiped. Don’t ever ask 
a user to type the same thing twice; this happens far too often.</p></section><section id="whitespace"><h2>Whitespace</h2><p>Ok, enough on blocks of content. How about the content - the questions 
and the form elements themselves? The easiest trick to make the form 
easier to complete is to reduce clutter, and thus distractions. Increase 
the whitespace between elements (don’t worry users know how to scroll 
if necessary), and remove any superfluous content on the page.  Whitespace
provides three distinct purposes.</p><ul><li><strong>Scannability</strong>. As mentioned, users scan rather than read and whitespace helps distinguish between distinct parts of the form. Adding
significant whitespace between the grouping of content discussed above
is especially important.</li><li><strong>Comprehension</strong>. Whitespace around text makes it easier to comprehend. Just look how easy it is to read this without any distracting 
content on the sides of the page. Just the important stuff in a field of nothingness.</li><li><strong>Direction</strong>. Communicating elements - call-to-action buttons, error messages, etc - are much more obvious when the rest of the content
is subdued and there are fewer distractions. The whitespace is directing
the user towards what is actually important.</li></ul></section><section id="single-column"><h2>Single Column</h2><p>User research, consistently proves that users find forms much easier to 
fill out and make fewer mistakes if they are presented each of the questions 
and fields in a sequential order. <strong>One at a time, from top to bottom</strong>. 
It goes back to the whole scanning behaviour: having all of the content in 
one vertical column it is very easy to scan from one point of focus to 
the next. And even better, this is very easily to achieve in HTML and CSS, 
but if you need something more complex than the default browser behaviour, 
flexbox is the ideal solution as content can be arranged in a responsive 
manner and is supported by all major modern browsers. </p></section><section id="positioning-labels"><h2>Positioning Labels</h2><p>Another fact backed by plenty of research (see the sources) is that 
<strong>labels should be placed above a field</strong> rather than beside 
(left or right). Plenty on labelling will be discussed in the 
<a href="labelling">labelling</a> and <a href="i18n">internationalisation</a> 
sections, but it is worth mentioning that eye-tracking research has revealed 
that users scan down the left side of the form and will take more time 
to read labels if they fall between consecutive components of the form. 
This results in a smoother experience and fewer mistakes made.</p></section><section id="sources"><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">How Users read on the Web</a> - nngroup.com</li><li><a href="http://uxpod.com/definitive-advice-on-forms-an-interview-with-jessica-enders/">Definitive Advice on Forms: An Interview with Jessica Enders</a> - uxpod.com</li><li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure">Form Structure - Service Manual</a> - gov.uk</li><li><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hkqYXMeXPVgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=r9yY-3tS2l&amp;dq=%20forms%20that%20work&amp;lr">Forms that Work: Designing Web Forms for Usability</a> - books.google.co.uk - Caroline Jarrett, Gerry Gaffney</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAAzdi1xuUY">Why headings and landmarks are so important -- A11ycasts #18</a> - youtube.com</li><li><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php">Label Placement in Forms</a> - uxmatter.com</li><li><a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2014/07/simple-is-better-making-your-web-forms.html">Simple is better - Making your web forms easy to use pays off</a> - research.googleblog.com</li><li><a href="https://shinesolutions.com/2017/05/02/its-not-you-its-your-form/">It's not you, it's your form.</a> - shinesolutions.com</li><li><a href="https://www.freshconsulting.com/uiux-principle-12-white-space-is-an-essential-design-asset/">UI/UX Principle #12: Whitespace is an Essential Design Asset</a> - freshconsulting.com</li></ul></section><section id="additional-resources"><h2>Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/">Website Forms Usability: Top 10 Recommendations</a> - nngroup.com</li><li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/">Better Form Design: One Thing Per Page (Case Study)</a> - smashingmagazine.com</li><li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">A Guide to Flexbox</a> - css-tricks.com</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@david.gilbertson/11-things-i-learned-reading-the-flexbox-spec-5f0c799c776b">11 things I learned reading the flexbox spec</a> - medium.com</li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/us-wizard/">Crafting a wizard</a> - ibm.com</li><li><a href="http://babich.biz/wizard-design-pattern/">Wizard Design Patterns</a> - babich.biz</li><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-2">Smashing Book #2 (eBook)</a> - shop.smashingmagazine.com</li></ul></section><section class="issue_footer">Corrections?
