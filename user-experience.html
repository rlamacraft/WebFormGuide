consider the User Experience. Users do not enjoy filling out forms; 
they just want to get in and get out. The experience should be 
pleasant and positive, but most of all it should be quick and 
frictionless. Your form should be intuitive to use for all of your 
users and leave the user with a state of satisfaction in a job completed.</p></section><nav class="contents"><h2>Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#research">Research</a></li><li><a href="#user-flows">User Flows</a></li><li><a href="#aesthetics">Aesthetics</a></li><li><a href="#wording">Wording</a></li><li><a href="#question-protocols">Question Protocols</a></li><li><a href="#sources">Sources</a></li><li><a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a></li></ul></nav><section id="research"><h2>Research</h2><p>Before starting any project it should be understood precisely who the 
system is being designed for. Feedback on every stage of development 
is a requirement for building a successful system; to ensure that the 
specification accurately reflects the needs of the end user, to ensure 
every prototype is catching all of the potential issues, and finally 
to ensure that the final product is usable by the end user. Forms, and 
more specifically, Web forms, are no different.</p><p>There are an endless number of variables. Do you know where in the 
world they are? Do you know how old they are, what languages they 
speak, how technically literate they are? What browser or device do 
they use? Do they have an impairments, temporary or permanent, that 
may hinder their ability to complete the form? Will they/do they 
return often to your form? The answers to all of these questions (and 
many more) should tightly influence the design of the form. To 
consider exactly how, it is worth categorising aspects of a form into 
the following three categories: <a href="#user-flows">user flows</a>, 
<a href="#aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, and <a href="#wording">wording</a>.</p></section><section id="user-flows"><h2>User Flows</h2><p>It may seem obvious at first (after all the user goes from the start 
to the end of the form), but the flow of the form is an important 
consideration especially for longer forms where the user may get 
distracted or confused as they progress through each step of your form. 
It is quite likely that your form will not be the only thing that the 
user is focused on - their concentration is very unlikely to be 100% - 
so the means to get through the form as fast as possible should be 
exceptionally clear.</p><p>It is worth taking the time to consider whether any of the following 
are true for your form, and if any are then it is worth taking the 
time to consider how the form could be re-structured to reduce the 
added to complexity to the flow.</p><ul><li><strong>Are there any splits in the user’s flow?</strong> Skippable questions? Decision points where the user may end up in different places? There 
are definitely no dead-ends, right?</li><li><strong>Are there any breaks in the user’s flow?</strong>  Long loading/waiting times? Pop-up windows? (Lots of information in the 
<a href="components#modal">modal</a> section). Will the user need to 
go away and loop information up or gather documentation? Can the 
details of that information be given up front?</li></ul></section><section id="aesthetics"><h2>Aesthetics</h2><p>The visual appeal of the form can make an enormous difference to the 
user experience, however, it is worth keeping mind that a completable, 
but ugly form, is better than a form that is a beautiful but the user 
can’t complete because of any number of user flows or wording issues. 
Many aspects of the <a href="design">design</a> and <a href="layout">layout</a> 
will be discussed in their respective sections, as well as a discussion 
of relevant sub-topics in the <a href="a11y">accessibility</a> 
section, but it is worth keeping in mind some of the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce clutter</strong>. Visual noise is distracting, and if all the user wants to do is complete the form then everything else is a 
distraction. Letting the form elements breath is also important and 
if the form is confusing to complete you’re probably not using enough 
whitespace - though remember to keep associated elements visually close together.</li><aside><span class="term">Design Affordances</span>Intuitive design that signals the opportunity to perform an action. 
<em>A teapot has a handle and spout that visually describe how to use a teapot</em>.</aside><li><strong>Provide affordances</strong> in the design. This helps communicate visually to the user what they can action and should also be used for 
ensuring <a href="a11y">accessible</a> design. Common design 
affordances include making buttons look clickable, especially making 
primary buttons stand out. This 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tzEil5TL0">YouTube tutorial by Rob Dobson</a> 
is a good introduction.</li><li><strong>Make state and progress very clear</strong>; this encourages users to complete the form as they see the light at the end of the tunnel and 
also provides a means to give feedback on the validity of their 
inputs (see <a href="validation">validation</a>).</li><li><strong>Strictly adhere to best practices</strong>; this ensures the accessibility of your form and compatibility with the myriad of 
devices. Standards exist for a reason. Many of the best practices 
will be discussed in other sections throughout this guide. </li><li><strong>Keep things simple, stupid</strong>.  Don’t over engineer the form - keep any executing code small, simple, and performant. Use 
<a href="design#motion">animation</a> for effective 
communication of state, but do not use excessively. Likewise for 
<a href="design#colour">colour</a>: it can be used for 
drawing attention to communicating information (such as errors), but 
should not be overused.</li></ul></section><section id="wording"><h2>Wording</h2><p>Wording will be covered in depth in the <a href="labelling">labelling</a>
section, with some discussion in the <a href="components">components</a>
and <a href="a11y">accessibility</a> sections, but the 
following principles are the main topics that should be considered.</p><ul><li><strong>Be clear, specific, and direct</strong>. Ambiguous, confusing, or vague explanations and descriptions make filing out forms hard - at 
no point should the user be forced to question what exactly is being 
asked of them. Do not roll multiple questions into one to reduce the 
number of questions as that can lead to more complex questions and 
confusing edge-cases.</li><li><strong>Use the user's vocabulary</strong>. This goes back to knowing your user, and is especially true when the user is required to input 
information on a domain of knowledge they are not comfortable with 
such as their health. Use terms they are comfortable with and would 
use in everyday conversation. Also, do not use unexplained acronyms 
or abbreviations unless you can guarantee every user knows and 
remembers them (which is unlikely).</li><li><strong>Use a conversational tone that reflects the tone of the service</strong>. If the user is signing up for a bank account or applying for a travel 
visa then the form should be serious and formal, but if the user is 
just signing up for an email newsletter or giving feedback on a service 
then an approachable, informal tone is more appropriate.</li></ul></section><section id="question-protocols"><h2>Question Protocols</h2><p>It is worth taking the time to carefully consider how you use the data 
collected from your users, identify whether you strictly need all of the 
questions, and ponder similar such questions. This is the job of the 
question protocol. Some possible additional questions to consider include
the following but it will depend on your particular service.</p><ul><li>Who within the organisation uses the answers?</li><li>What do they use the information for?</li><li>Is the information absolutely necessary?</li><li>If it is required, what happens if the user enters the wrong thing, intentionally or by accident?</li><li>Or what happens if the user’s info changes?</li><li>How long will the data be stored for?</li><li>Most importantly, what legal and <a href="privacy">privacy</a> issues may there be with the collected data?</li></ul><p>Every question has a cost based on the required cognitive load to answer 
it, too much and users will give up, leave, or become frustrated. This 
can be avoided by minimising the number of the questions, splitting complex 
questions up, and using multiple <a href="layout#paging">pages</a>.</p></section><section id="sources"><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-essential-guide-to-writing-effective-survey-questions/">The Essential Guide to Writing Effective Survey Questions</a> - uxbooth.com</li><li><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php">The Question Protocol: How to Make Sure Every Form Is Necessary</a> - uxmatters.com</li><li><a href="http://uxpod.com/definitive-advice-on-forms-an-interview-with-jessica-enders/">Definitive Advice on Forms: An Interview with Jessica Enders</a> - uxpod.com</li><li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure">Form Structure - Service Manual</a> - gov.uk</li></ul></section><section id="additional-resources"><h2>Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals">UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals</a> - thehipperelement.com</li><li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/">UX Research Cheat Sheet</a> - nngroup.com</li><li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/does-user-annoyance-matter/">Does User Annoyance Matter?</a> - nngroup.com</li><li><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hkqYXMeXPVgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=r9yY-3tS2l&amp;dq=%20forms%20that%20work&amp;lr">Forms that Work: Designing Web Forms for Usability</a> - books.google.co.uk - Caroline Jarrett, Gerry Gaffney</li><li><a href="http://www.experienceux.co.uk/ux-blog/2017/03/09/ux-insider-interview-caroline-jarrett-discusses-forms-surveys-need-brave/">Caroline Jarret discusses forms, surveys, and the need to brave.</a> - experienceux.co.uk</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0994347057/informdesign">Designing UX Forms: Create Forms That Don't Drive Your Users Crazy</a> - amazon.com - Jessica Enders</li></ul></section><section class="issue_footer">Corrections?
