<a href="user-experience#user-flows">User Flows</a>, 
<a href="user-experience#question-protocols">Question Protocols</a>, and general 
<a href="layout">Layout</a>, the visual design is the next obvious consideration 
for improving the usability of a form. A number of different aspect of 
the design of forms will be discussed here but ultimately the aim is to 
reduce distractions and clearly communicate the necessary information.</p></section><nav class="contents"><h2>Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#typography">Typography</a></li><li><a href="#iconography">Iconography</a></li><li><a href="#colour">Colour</a></li><li><a href="#motion">Motion</a></li><li><a href="#sources">Sources</a></li><li><a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a></li></ul></nav><section id="typography"><h2>Typography</h2><p>Ensuring that text is readable is not hard; browser defaults generally 
provide a good experience for most able users. However, it is important 
that any design is compatible with <a href="a11y">accessibility technologies</a> 
(zooming, variable default browser font size, screen readers, etc).</p><ul><li>First and foremost, choosing a readable font-family is of great importance. <strong>A simplistic style, ideally sans-serif, is important</strong>, however 
there is still sufficient possible variation to reflect the tone of 
your service. As with all Web development, if it is possible to avoid 
downloading additional fonts then that would be a preferable choice 
to megabytes of custom fonts, simply for performance reasons.</li><li><strong>Avoid excessively thin text</strong> (a minimum font-weight 300 is a good rule) that will be hard to read for those with visual impairment, 
or simply users in poor lighting conditions.</li><li><strong>Don’t have excessively long lines</strong>. The length of these lines on desktop should be considered an absolute maximum as it makes it harder 
to read.</li><li><strong>Don’t have a tiny font size</strong>. <span style="font-size:.5em;">This is really hard to read isn't it</span>.</li><li style="line-height:.85;"><strong>Don't have a low line-height value</strong><br>This is also hard to read.</li><li style="line-height:2;"><strong>But also don't have a huge line-height</strong>.<br>1.4 is about ideal for body text, which is what the line-height for 
the rest of the text on the page is.</li></ul></section><section id="iconography"><h2>Iconography</h2><p>Icons can provide variation in the visual design - breaking up otherwise 
large amounts of text and empty fields. It also allows users to scan and 
identify fields more effectively, and are typically used in conjunction 
with component labels. </p><ul><li><strong>Should be simple, intuitive, and bold</strong>. This makes it easy to scan the components of the form, especially for returning users who 
associate the icons with particular information points that they may 
just be looking for rather than completing every field.</li><li><strong>Not sufficient to unambiguously communicate information</strong>; for example it is not enough to communicate errors with only an icon, a 
textual explanation should also be used, as icons can be interpreted 
differently by different users and the textual label is also necessary
for screen readers.</li><li><strong>As an addition when communicating state</strong>, for example where red error messages would not be obvious to a colour blind user the addition 
of a warning icon (perhaps an exclamation in a triangle) would make 
this more obvious.</li></ul></section><section id="colour"><h2>Colour</h2><p>A strategic use of colour can make a form easier to complete by guiding 
the user through the form and maximising the usability of all of the content.</p><p>First and foremost, it is a good practice to design the form (or any website 
in general) in greyscale and then add small amounts of colour where it 
is beneficial for the user experience. A single accent colour, with possibly 
a few shades, is ideal here which can then be <strong>applied to elements that should draw the user’s attention.</strong>
These may be call-to-action elements, 
such as primary buttons, hyperlinks, or even just banners and borders 
that highlight key elements. The key, however, is to limit the user of 
colour to maximise the effect of where it is used. <strong>Excessive colour is distracting, so don’t do it.</strong></p><p>Colour can also be used to communicate state. For this it is best to to 
use primary colours that are quite distinct from the branding colours 
of your website and are similar to the standard colours for the respective 
purpose. For example, it is standard practice to use red for errors; highlighting 
invalid data, for example. Amber may also be used for warnings, or green 
for success. <aside><span class="term">Red or Amber?</span>If in doubt when to use red or amber: one possible way of consider the 
different is if action has to be taken now (such as fixing invalid input) 
then display red, if action should be taken at some point in the future 
(e.g. service will be down for maintenance) then use amber.</aside>However, it is not sufficient to use colours changes on their 
own to communicate information as it can be difficult if not impossible 
for some colour blind users to be able to perceive this change - for example, 
error warnings denoting <a href="validation">invalid data entry</a> 
should display both a colour change to red as well as 
<strong>both a useful icon and a textual explanation of what the field is expecting</strong>.</p><p>Whenever there is some content (could be text, icons, fields, images, 
anything) on some background it is important there is sufficient contrast 
in order to make it clearly visible for all users. Low contrast can cause 
eyestrain or simply not visible to users with a visual impairment, and 
as a result Web Content Accessibility Guidelines specify a <strong>contrast ratio of 4.5:1</strong>. There are some links below to tools that can help in selecting 
colours. Moreover, there is one additional caveat when selecting the font 
colours and background colours of text: true black (#000) can be difficult 
to read on as it looks unnatural and true white (#fff) can be too similar 
to staring straight into a beaming light. To mimic printed text it is 
generally best practice to use off-black text on an off-white background. 
Check the colour of this text, you’ll see it is a much softer shade.</p></section><section id="motion"><h2>Motion</h2><p>Animation is an effective way to bring life to a user interface, however, 
should be used for specific and effective purposes. Some of those purposes, 
where the animation adds to the user experience, include the following.</p><ul><li><strong>Orientation:</strong> for denoting progress - especially through pages of a form - through a series or sequence of steps. Animating content 
in or out is a good way to communicate this, such as a calendar component 
expanding or modals popping up.</li><li><strong>Functional Change:</strong> describe a change in the behaviour of interacting with a UI element, such as open-close toggles. This may involve animating 
between the design of two icons, or revealing and covering textual labels
to explain what the new function of the element is.</li><li><strong>New Element:</strong> to draw focus to new content that has been added to the page. This should be used in conjunction with drawing screen reader 
focus to announce the change. Human eyes are good at noticing movement 
and so animating content in does this effectively.</li><li><strong>Highlight:</strong> to draw focus to existing content. This can be effective in guiding the user through the form to important components or information. 
Animating colour change or subtle movement of icons or labels will draw
the user's attention to specific parts of the form, for example a very
subtly pulsing submit button.</li><li><strong>Visual Feedback & System Status:</strong> communicate information to user that something is happening, or why something has happened. Spinners, 
progress bars, dismissing content, or even buttons that shake when the 
action cannot be completed, are all examples.</li></ul><p>It is important that animations are performant so that the webpage continues 
to be rendered a 60 frames a second. To do this it is generally best to 
stick to the transform and opacity CSS properties. For more information, 
there are plenty of useful resources linked below.</p><p>Animation should, however, be kept to a minimum as it can be distracting 
especially for those with cognitive disabilities.</p></section><section id="sources"><h2>Sources</h2><li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> - w3.org</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-not-suck-at-design-a-5-minute-guide-for-the-non-designer-291efac43037">How to not suck at design, a 5 minute guide for the non-designer.</a> - medium.com</li><li><a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">Design Tip: Never Use Black</a> - ianstormtaylor.com</li><li><a href="http://edwardsanchez.me/blog/13589712">Icons vs Labels vs Both</a> - edwardsanchez.me</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeuNIOuIEDA">Animating the Moments — Using Animation in UX (CSS Animations Series Part 3)</a> - youtube.com - DevTips</li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/animations/">Animations</a> - developers.google.com</li></section><section id="additional-resources"><h2>Additional Resources</h2><li><a href="http://donnieberg.github.io/promises/">Promises to Users.</a> - donnieberg.github.io</li><li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/">The Equilateral Triangle of a Perfect Paragraph</a> - css-tricks.com</li><li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/icons-as-part-of-a-great-user-experience/">Icons As Part Of A Great User Experience</a> - smashingmagazine.com</li><li><a href="https://uxplanet.org/essential-color-tools-for-ux-designers-530036eaf9ae">Essential Color Tools for UX Designers</a> - uxplanet.org</li><li><a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Color Contrast Checker</a> - webaim.org</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LvJ8VctoXnPI0dtE40wfid">CSS Animations Series</a> - youtube.com - DevTips</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNyy5eYfbc">High performance web user interfaces - Google I/O 2016</a> - youtube.com - Google Chrome Developers</li><li><a href="https://csstriggers.com/">CSS Triggers</a> - csstrigger.com, on performant animatable CSS properties</li></section><section class="issue_footer">Corrections?
